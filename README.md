# Elite-Reads-Recommender
The 'Elite Reads Recommender' is a machine learning project implemented in Python using pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. It processes book, user, and rating datasets to create two recommendation systems: one based on popularity metrics and another using collaborative filtering with cosine similarity. The project involves data cleaning, exploration, and serialization for efficient storage and retrieval of key data structures, optimizing the recommendation process.

It further integrates a Flask-based web application with a well-designed HTML frontend, enhancing the user experience by providing an intuitive interface to interact with the recommendation system. The Flask framework facilitates easy deployment, enabling users to access personalized book suggestions seamlessly.
